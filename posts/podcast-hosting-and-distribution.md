    A transistor consists of three layers of semiconductor material, usually silicon, with impurities (doping) added to create p-type and n-type regions. By controlling the flow of charge carriers (electrons and holes) between these regions, the transistor can amplify signals, switch current on and off, or oscillate to produce a periodic signal.
    Transistors are widely used in a variety of electronic devices, from simple analog circuits to complex digital systems. They are found in radios, televisions, computers, mobile phones, and many other devices, and have had a profound impact on our daily lives and the world at large.
