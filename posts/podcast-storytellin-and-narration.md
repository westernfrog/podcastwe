Interview-based storytelling is a style of podcasting where the host conducts interviews with different individuals and uses their stories as the basis of the podcast. The host may ask questions and guide the conversation to highlight specific aspects of the interviewee's story, but the focus is on letting the interviewee speak and share their experiences.<br/>
This type of storytelling can be used to cover a wide range of topics and perspectives, from personal experiences to expert opinions. It can also be used to tell stories in a more informal and conversational manner, allowing the listener to feel like they are a part of the conversation.<br/>
To create an effective interview-based podcast, it's important to have a clear focus for each episode and to choose interviewees who are knowledgeable and engaging. The host should also be prepared with well-researched questions and be able to guide the conversation in an interesting and meaningful way.<br/>
Overall, interview-based storytelling can be a great way to create an engaging and informative podcast that showcases different perspectives and experiences. By bringing in diverse voices and stories, interview-based podcasts can provide a wealth of knowledge and inspiration to listeners.
