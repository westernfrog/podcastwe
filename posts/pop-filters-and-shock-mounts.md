#### Pop Filters

<p class="text-md">
A pop filter, also known as a windscreen or a pop shield, is a device that is used to reduce the impact of plosive sounds in vocal recordings. Plosive sounds are created when a speaker says a word that starts with a hard "p" or "b" sound, causing a burst of air to hit the microphone and create a popping or thumping noise.

A pop filter works by creating a physical barrier between the speaker's mouth and the microphone. The barrier absorbs or diffuses the burst of air from the plosives, preventing it from hitting the microphone directly and creating unwanted noise.

Pop filters come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and can be made from materials such as metal mesh, foam, or fabric. When selecting a pop filter for your microphone, it's important to consider the size and shape of the filter, as well as the distance between the filter and the microphone, to ensure that it works effectively.

Using a pop filter is an important step in achieving high-quality audio recordings, especially when recording vocals or voiceovers. By reducing the impact of plosive sounds, a pop filter can help you produce cleaner and more professional-sounding recordings</p>

#### Pop Filters And Shock Mounts Are?

<p class="text-md">A pop filter is a device attached to the end of a microphone that helps reduce plosive sounds (sudden bursts of air from pronunciation of words starting with "p" or "b") in recorded speech. A shock mount is a type of microphone holder that helps reduce noise from vibrations, such as handling noise or floor vibrations, that can be transmitted through the microphone stand to the microphone. Both pop filters and shock mounts are commonly used in podcasting to improve audio quality.</p>
